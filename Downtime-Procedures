# Downtime Procedures (Clinical Systems)

## Objective
Ensure continuity of patient care during IT system unavailability.

---

## Downtime Triggers
- EMR / HIS unavailable > 5 minutes
- PACS / LIS inaccessible
- Network outage in patient care areas

---

## Standard Downtime Actions
- Switch to pre-approved paper forms
- Manual patient registration if required
- Manual order entry and result documentation
- Timestamp all manual entries

---

## Recovery Process
- IT confirms system stability
- Clinical teams re-enter critical data
- IT validates data integrity
- Formal downtime closure communication

---

## Key Principle
Downtime is a **clinical process**, not an IT failure.
